/// 1. A mutex cannot be `unlock`ed by a different thread than the one that `lock`ed the mutex.
/// 2. A mutex only reprents the semaphore's values of `0` or `1`.
/// Because of these restrictions, a mutex is faster than a semaphore.
///
/// A semaphore can emulate a mutex by using `starting_value = 1`, and
/// then using `acquire` and `release` instead of `lock` and `unlock`.
///
/// A mutex has pointer semantics.  So you are free to copy
/// or move the struct as long as you only `drop` it once.
